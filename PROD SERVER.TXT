//After running `npm run build`, your production files are generated in the `dist` directory. To see your production build, you need to serve the files from that directory.

### Steps to View Your Production Server:

1. **Navigate to the `dist` Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd dist
   ```

2. **Serve the Files**:
   You can serve the files using a simple HTTP server. If you don't have a server installed, you can quickly use `serve` or `http-server`. Hereâ€™s how to use both:

   **Using `serve`**:
   - First, install it globally (if you haven't already):
     ```bash
     npm install -g serve
     ```
   - Then, run:
     ```bash
     serve
     ```
   - This will serve your files, and it will provide you a URL (usually `http://localhost:5000`) to view your app.

   **Using `http-server`**:
   - First, install it globally (if you haven't already):
     ```bash
     npm install -g http-server
     ```
   - Then, run:
     ```bash
     http-server
     ```
   - This will also serve your files, typically at `http://localhost:8080`.

3. **Open in Browser**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` or `http://localhost:8080`) to see your production build.

### Note:
- If you're deploying this to a remote server or cloud service, you'd typically upload the contents of the `dist` directory to your hosting service's web root directory, and then access it via your domain or IP address.
